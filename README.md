This is a recreated version of "The World's Hardest Game". It consists only of 5 levels as it's a prototype. Just like in the original game you must collect all yellow
coins, avoid all blue enemies and get to the furthest green area. All other ones are checkpoints. Be aware, dying resets all coins. You can enter cheat codes by pressing
left ctrl. Here are the codes:
gamerule.god=True - sets god mode;
gamerule.god=False - sets normal mode;
gameplay.coins.collect=all - collects all coins;
gameplay.enemies.neutralise=all - kills all enemies;
gameplay.level.switch=*level number* - switches to the level you select;
gameplay.progress.deaths.remove=all - clears deaths
